#MMUtility
=========

**Objective C convenience methods to do miscellaneous tasks on iOS (and possibly Mac OS X)**

MMUtility contains various convenience methods to do various tasks on iOS. All methods are public and static. To use them, just 
call the method on the class (e.g. `[MMUtility trim:myString]`). Most of the methods do tedious tasks that I find myself doing 
frequently (like getting the application's documents directory.) Read the comments in `MMUtility.h` to see what it can do for 
you in more detail. I tried to give the methods descriptive names, so it almost documents itself.
